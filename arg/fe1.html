			<p>Now, let me present you with the undeniable evidence:</p>
			<p>1. Go to spotthestation.nasa.gov to look up ISS flyover times, and see it for yourself.  ISS doesn't work on a flat earth.</p>
			<p>2. The Sun does not change size throughout the day, and using this knowledge and basic geometry, we can infer that the Sun does not change it's distance to us either.  Coupled with the fact that the Sun always moves at a rate almost exactly equal to 15 deg/hour, it is clear proof that the Sun moves across the sky in the exact same fashion you would expect on the normal rotating Earth.  Use a planetarium app such as SpaceEngine to get a better grasp on what I'm talking about.</p>
			<p>3. GPS can be clearly proven to use satellites.  GPS will still function normally when there is no cell service whatsoever.  It will still function if there is radio shielding to block off any possible signals coming from the Earth or things on the Earth.  Therefore, it has to be using things in the sky.  Further inspection of the software in a GPS receiver would confirm without a doubt that it uses satellites that are orbiting above the Earth to triangulate it's own position.</p>
			<p>4. If you keep track of the position of all stars in the night sky, perhaps with a long-exposure camera, you would see that they are all rotating on a supposed "celestial sphere" in the night sky.  The only way that this would work for every location on Earth is if the stars are standing still and the Earth is a rotating sphere.  If you want, you can compound this with the fact that the star Polaris is completely invisible in the southern hemisphere, as it is completely below the horizon.  This is not geometrically possible if the stars are embedded on a rotating celestial dome above a flat Earth, as it would appear to be off-center and not rotating linearly if you were observing from any point other than the north pole.</p>
			<p>Let's finish with something completely obvious:</p>
			<p>5. The Sun sets at night.  Not possible if the Sun is always at least 10 degrees above the horizon, as you would expect on a flat Earth.  Also, remember that the Sun is always observed to move at the same rate across the sky throughout the day, which cannot happen if the Sun has to stay above the horizon, as it would have to slow down and stop descending.</p>
