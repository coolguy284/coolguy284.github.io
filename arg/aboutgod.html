------------ARGUMENT 5------------

0:28	I guess.

2:25	Even the most knowledgeable person alive probably only knows 0.001% of the total of human knowledge.

2:48	Yeah, I can go with that.

------------ARGUMENT 4------------

3:11		Your argument can be explained by the Anthropic Principle, i.e. if constants were messed up we wouldn't even exist in order to ponder why we exist.  So no matter how rare it is for humanity to exist (as long as probability is above zero which it is), in a possibly infinite universe, it could happen and obviously it had to because we are here now.  If you are having trouble understanding just look up the Anthropic Principle.

3:36	The Moon does not affect the viability of life on Earth.

3:46	Our position in our galaxy also has minimal effect on the viability of life on Earth, except perhaps at the center, near the supermassive black hole.

3:58	Gravity could be made weaker without too much trouble, and it could be made slightly stronger up to a point as well.  It would just mean that our planet would be bigger or smaller in order to have the same acceleration at the surface.  You show a clip of a black hole, however that is not really relevant as black holes are rare anyway.

4:02	Lemme reiterate the fact that it is perfectly explained by the Anthropic Principle.

4:18	Matt Dillahunty has thoroughly debunked the notion that it takes more faith to be an atheist than a theist.  The probability of a certain god existing decreases as you add more and more constraints.  The number of constraints added to God in the bible is large enough to make the probability of that certain god existing near zero.

If you want a proper explanation, visit the "Fine-tuned universe" Wikipedia page.

4:45	Evolution isn't a belief.  It's a proven fact.  The theory of evolution is our attempt to explain that fact.  All you have to do is read the Wikipedia page for it and search for all the transition fossils between two desired species.

4:51	This is why we must always reason from first principles.  As all good scientists should do.

4:57	How do I observe this "eternal power" and "divine nature"?  Is it a form of electromagnetic radiation so I can see it?  Or a vibration of the air so I can hear it?  Or chemicals in the air so I can smell it?  Chemicals on my tongue so I can taste it?  What is it?  I'm not without excuse given the fact that I can explain away your previous statements with the Anthropic Principle.

------------ARGUMENT 3------------

5:19 - 5:52	What??  Was this an attempt to use inspiring music with slow words and scenes to attempt to convice the viewer of the existence of god through emotion?  Because that's a very dirty tactic, and it's "not good science".

5:59	And there's no equivalent pathos music here.  I wonder what side they are biased toward?  And remember, the null hypothesis is always assumed correct until proven wrong.

6:02	Nope.  You misunderstand evolution.

Evolution explains how single-celled organisms' DNA randomly mutates until they become multicellular, and since that is in certain cases more favorable for reproduction, the mutations stick.  And after that species mutate to having more and more cells until they slowly develop a circulatory system, all the while species that don't do this are outcompeted or obsoleted and don't survive to this day (or they might, just not as a dominant species).  This continues with more and more complexities being added, then species break out of the ocean and move on to land, all the while getting more advanced in this particular area due to the fact that random mutations to make them more advanced make them reproduce more and become more prevalent.  This goes on, with animals gaining abilities and intelligence gradually over millions of years until we get to us, humans.

Nothing supernatural required, no coming from nothing required by evolution.

The question is ACTUALLY instead "how did life originate in the first place"?  The answer to which is still debated in the scientific community as there is no true answer yet.  However, the most likely theory is that, over hundreds of millions of years (SO SO SO MUCH TIME TO DEAL WITH THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW!! EVEN 10 YEARS IS LONG IMAGINE 1,000,000X THAT!!!  DEEP TIME IS AMAZING AND ALLOWS FOR CRAZY THINGS THAT SEEM LIKE THEY TAKE FOREVER TO OCCUR!!  Okay, I've got that out of my system.), simple chemicals happened to fall into a self replicating pattern (Remember, this is happening across all of Earth's oceans, in every single litre of it, so there is a crazy amount of parallellism helping this happen fast.  In fact, some people speculate that this could happen within a year.) that, like in the previous explanatory paragraph, grows in complexity (due to it being favorable to do so) until you have the standard single-celled organism.

There is more to this, but I'll wait till a later timestamp.

6:06	That is a pretty maimed version of the 1st law of thermodynamics but sure, that law applies in our universe, all the way to it's beginning as far as we know.

6:14	Evolution and the Big Bang Theory are two seperate things.

6:16	The initial singularity of the universe DID NOT do any spinning.  It simply sat there, with infinite density, containing all the mass / energy in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE, in a much smaller region.

6:20	This tiny singularity with all the mass in the universe quickly expanded into a more reasonable density, then slowly expanded until it got to the size it is today.

6:26	OH NO! THE DRACONIC REACTOR BLEW!!!  (I just had to insert that joke there because the sound effect was similar.  If you don't know what it is, it is a dangerous unstable reactor from modded Minecraft that has an incredibly powerful explosion.)

Also the video clip played here is far from a realistic depiction of the universe during it's early life.

The big bang was not an EXPLOSION, it was an EXPANSION.  THE FABRIC OF SPACE ITSELF expanded tremendously at the instant of the universe's modern beginning.  Before then it was scrunched into an unimaginably tiny space.  A traditional explosion explodes into something, however the big bang WAS THE SOMETHING.  So there would be no "outside perspective" to observe it from, as the only possible places to be would be inside the universe.

6:34	Nothing and a piece of matter are two different things.  The "piece of matter" in question would LITERALLY CONTAIN ALL THE MASS AND ENERGY THERE IS.  "Nothing" is very different from that.

6:39	The universe can operate without divine intervention, and possibly even without divine creation (For multiverse theories and such, which, along with god, are unprovable, unfalsifiable concepts.  And unfalsifiable concepts are just an interesting curiosity that should be placed on a shelf, not something that should be seriously considered, because there is no way to prove them one way or the other).

6:45	That's the thing about science.  We don't know about everything, and it is especially hard to make theories about things before the big bang because they are unobservable.

7:45	There is no issue with infinite regress, because physics and math, unlike humans, are not offended by infinity.

8:03	Just note that any argument about god being always there can be applied to the universe or multiverse as well.  Why can't the initial singularity have also just existed forever as well then?  Why can't it have been "always there"?

8:06	Two different things, but I'll hear you out.

8:24	But??  Space and time are constructs of physics, and the laws of physics break down near the intial singularity!  Electromagnetism and the weak force merge together, then strong force merges with them, then possibly even gravity and the fabric of spacetime merge with the strong-electroweak force as well!  You cannot apply physical rules to a point in time before the big bang because that would be an impossibility, exactly like a point on Earth with latitude greater than 90.  It just doesn't make sense to talk about things like that.

The energy / mass existed first, then (because it happened to be in an unstable state) it expanded into space, with the laws of physics appearing and taking meaning then.  Science breaks down at the big bang theory.  None of these things had to come into existence at the same time, because it just doesn't make sense yet to ask that kind of question.

8:29	Evolution does not answer questions about the big bang, just like how particle physics does not help you with your Algebra homework.  Why is evolution a catch all word for you, when you really mean the big bang theory?

8:48	Of course evolution cannot answer this question.  Evolution cannot answer ANY question about the big bang.

8:50	The god of the gaps is not reasoning from first principles.  It is formulating a supernatural being that can solve all unsolved questions in science, and answer it in the least informative way, too.  If we stated that things fell because of god instead of the curvature of spacetime, and did that to other things, imagine where we would be with science now.  Stuck in the stone ages.  Catch-all, unfalsifiable theories are not the true path to knowledge.

9:01	The big bang version:  In the beginning (time) a pile of infinitely dense spacetime (matter) expanded (space) rapidly into a normal universe, which then slowly expanded until today.  And before the beginning, time did not exist, similarly to how there is no point on the Earth's surface that is south of the south pole.

9:05	Time, space, and matter being a trinity is a biblical concept.  In the actual standard model of physics, a lot of things came into existence: mass / energy (which may have already been there in the first place), followed by spacetime (Space and time are part of one fabric, and time behaves like an imaginary dimension relative to space (imaginary is a mathematical term, relating to complex numbers). For more info read up about general and special relativity.) and the strong-electroweak force, which later splits off into the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, and a whole host of other things.

9:13	This is literally stuck in the early 20th century.

Past - present - future are arbitrary divisions of time, just like how x<-1, x=-1, -1<x<1, x=1, x>1 are five arbitrary divisions of the real number line.  It only has a significance for a certain event or perspective in spacetime and even somebody's past can be someone else's future due to relativity.

Length - width - height are just a strange way to state that our universe has three dimensions of space.

Thinking of space and time as seperate things, as I said before, is something that only made sense before Einstein published the theory of relativity.

And the worst part is solid - liquid - gas.  There are many more phases of matter than that, supercondictivity, superfluidity, bose-einstein condensate, and most notably plasma are some examples.  Also, at high enough temperatures, the distinction between liquid and gas vanishes, losing all meaning (called the critical point).  The phases of matter are only one of the many ways to think of matter, and they neglect energy (photons, gluons, and others) entirely.

This trinity has no significance, simply because I can create my own trinities about absolutely anything:

The Web trinity of trinities:
1. The Internet:
 UDP / TCP / TLS
2. The Server:
 Python / Node.js / C#
3. The Client:
 HTML / CSS / JS

As you can see, the fact that things can be made into a trinity of trinities does not mean anything.

9:37	A god of the universe would most certainly be outside of our universe, but "in" it and "through" it are strange statements to make.

For example, a Minecraft player in creative mode could be considered a god of it's Minecraft world.  However, the only way to interact with blocks is to be near them, and it is impossible to see the entirety of a Minecraft world at once (it is 60,000,000 by 60,000,000 by 256 blocks in total, too much for any harddrive).

Someone who created this universe, if such a person exists, does not have to be omnipotent and all knowing.  For all we know, the universe could have been created by a team of beings, or it could be created by advanced humans, or it could have created itself.  All of these are unprovable hypotheses.

9:38	Why wouldn't he be?  Someone can get scared from a bad experience in Minecraft, the same would apply for someone in charge of the universe (if that person exists).

9:53	A limited god is already improbable enough, the more powers you give god the rarer it is for that particular god to exist.  When you say that the power is infinite, you reduce the probability to virtually zero, even worse if that god has to follow the specifics of the bible.

10:00	That's a matter of opinion.  I would call any creator of this universe a god by defintion but that's just my choice of definition.

10:10	As I said, the more restrictions you add, the rarer it becomes that that particular god exists.  Anyone can make statements about unobservables and unprovables, but since there is no way to confirm them, they must be set aside until further information is acquired, and that applies to you, too.

------------ARGUMENT 2------------

10:30	Yeah, that comes from natural selection making it so that species that don't want to kill members of their own kind more able to survive and reproduce, so add a few million years and here we are, with the same basic principles.

10:36	Yeah, all of these things arise from the way the human brain is wired, nothing more.  People with mental disorders are a good example of this, they may not know any of these things you stated, just because their brain happens to be wired abnormally due to a genetic defect or something.

10:43	As I said, it is common to feel that way, but sometimes that is not the case, like in the case of someone with a mental disorder.  They DON'T know, and that's it.

10:45	It comes from evolution, as I previously said.  This can be looked up on Wikipedia I'm sure.

10:58	Wrong.  You must assume that your brain is wired to feel certain things with certain situations that in your subjective opinion are good or evil or neither.  It's all subjective, NOT objective (there is no moral law of physics).

11:03	That was BAD logic, BAD logic.  You describle the subjective idea of morals and good and bad, and state that it isn't just an artefact of the way the human brain is wired, making a statement that isn't even unfalsifiable, it is easily falsifiable (mental disorders).  Then you proceed to make an argument based off that false premise, which in turn makes it false.

11:09	No need to repeat myself for the fifth time.

11:13 - 11:51	This is a whole big string of false premises, one after another.  You're making a whole lot of assumptions about me and you don't even know me.  Why would I get mad at someone who cheated on me?  I wouldn't.  In my subjective opinion, there is no reason to.  And even if I did, there is no objective reason for it, only a subjective reason that depends on the person and their neural arrangement.  Although it will be similar for everybody, as everyone's DNA is very close to each other (we're one species after all), there can be differences and there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DIVINE ABOUT IT.

------------ARGUMENT 1------------

12:43	That would also be the case if the entire world was freethinking, which is basically the reasoning-from-first-principlies version of Jesus, without the religious aspects, only with what can be proven, with everybody working together to better society.

13:01	There is a WaitButWhy post about what I'm referring to called "Religion for the Nonreligious" which is of a similar vein, just minus the religion.

13:30	Personal encounters are not valid scientific evidence.  But they do convince the person they happen to.  However, they can be explained without the use of the supernatural.  Matt Dillahunty talks about this as well.

14:13	Matt Dillahunty disproved this as well, by wishing in all his heart that god reveal himself to him, except it didn't happen.  Genetically Modified Skeptic actually DID have a personal experience with god, which he later debunked once he became atheist.

So there is my take on this video.  Feel free to comment for questions, and if I get notifications for them I will answer.
