"quit trying to tell us intelligent well researched flat earthers things we already know"
Lol.

"I am familiar with the nonsense that all of us were taught since birth."
You're actually indoctrinated into believing it's nonsense.

"You not educating me here this is a dialogue on having scientific proof, for which there is absolute certainty, which there absolutely is."
Nope.  You don't know science if you think absolute certainty in a theory is possible.  Believing in something with absolute certainty is being INDOCTRINATED.

"We know how to use and control electricity an invisible force"
ELECTRICITY ISN'T A FORCE.

Have you heard of electromagnetism?  One of the four fundamental forces?  Yeah, THAT'S a force.  Not electricity.  Electricity, magnetism, and light, all in one, is a force.

And just because your eyes can't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  You can indirectly observe it, by feeling tingling on your fingers if 100V+ is supplied to them, or seeing a filament light up.

"and we know it exists because we use the scientific method to demonstrate it with repeatable results."
This is clearly leading up to a climax.  Electromagnetism isn't just the result of one set of repeated results, it's a comprehensive theory that is knitted together from many smaller theories and experiments, with their results.

"The key here is duplicate or repeatable results."
Some things in science cannot be properly verified like this, this is not science.  Take the big bang, for instance, you cannot recreate it for experiments.  Anything on a cosmic scale cannot be experimented with, only observed.

"Can you demonstrate "gravity" to me, also an invisible force?"
Sure.  Why aren't you floating away from earth?  Why aren't the sun and planets exploding (as gravity is the only thing holding them together.  planet-planet collisions make this apparent, as planets behave like taffy)?

Take an object on a super precise scale, and measure it's mass at the equator and at the poles (antarctica preferably as it's a landmass).  You will find that it weighs slightly less on the equator, due to centrifugal force and being slightly further away from the earth's centre.  Or you could take measurements of the ISS, from observing it at night, and along with the help of several friends observations (for triangulation) calculate it's orbit using standard newtonian gravity (technically incorrect, but einsteinian gravity is only needed for extreme situations, where it behaves differently than newtonian gravity).  You would find that there's a 99.999...% match for predicted vs actual position (and much of that discrepancy would be measurement error not theory error).

For confirmation on Earth's near-spherical shape, just check out lunar eclipses.  Earth is always casting a circular shadow.

Or solar eclipses, for that matter, because in order to predict the very narrow band of totality with the precision that we do, a correct model is MANDATORY.  And guess what, timeanddate.com has the full predictions in advance, with accuracy in the seconds.  How is the heliocentric model incorrect then?

"Not on a "planetary" scale neither as that is not proof."
How is that not proof?  Are you DENYING EVIDENCE WHEN YOU SEE IT LIKE SOMEONE INDOCTRINATED?

The reason you don't accept "planetary" proof is because it would prove you wrong if you did.

"I mean scientifically in a lab?"
Oh, you mean the cavendish experiment (look up on wikipedia)?  Total proof as it's easily repeatable and can get close to the actual gravitational constant.

"The Greeks from that era were mostly philosophers sooo"
Ah, yes.  Because that somehow means anything in regards to whether they were right or not.

"Do you think using a compass on the under side of a ball earth should still be able to point north through the earth as all compasses point north?"
Did you know that compasses align to the direction of the magnetic field at that point, and in fact, only on the equator is the magnetic field parallel to the surface.  At the mid-latitudes, it actually points down (or up) at an angle, and at the magnetic poles, there really isn't any clear direction as it's mostly pointing straight up or down.

As to your question, OBVIOUSLY if a compass was nearer to the south pole then the north pole, it would be repelled by the south pole (instead of being attracted to the north pole), with the same visual result.

And somehow you're the one spoon feeding?  Look at how much paragraphs I'm typing in your favor!

"Or have you heard about the hoax compasses they sell in Australia that point to the south pole?"
This is making me internally giggle.
